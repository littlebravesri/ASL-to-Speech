# American Sign Language translation to Speech 

## Microsoft Student Accelerator Program 2021

### Findings and Reflection

The web app translates ASL to speech with the help of Azure services. The limitations of the web app are less accurate predictions and predicting 4 signs at a time, after which the camera should be restarted in order to continue predictions.

More training time and training images can help to improve the model's accuracy. 

Better images and better preprocessing techniques could also be performed to enhance the predcition accuracy.
